#architecture: C++ for scraping, Kafka for streaming, and React for displaying updates. They’re asking for a step-by-step breakdown of each technology and its purpose in the system. I'll start with defining Kafka and explaining its usefulness for streaming, explain what C++ is and why it's used for scraping data, and finally talk about React, which displays the updated information. I'll also dive into their roles and how they work as a system, aiming for clarity and simplicity.

The user wants a detailed rundown of the system’s components:

    C++ for web scraping: I'll explain using libraries like libcurl to fetch web pages and HTML parsers to extract data. C++ is chosen for its performance.

    Kafka for messaging: I’ll cover how Kafka streams messages, decoupling data extraction and presentation. Topics, partitions, and the roles of producers and consumers come into play here.

    React frontend: I’ll describe how React creates interactive, real-time UI that displays Kafka-streamed data.
